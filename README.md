# fast-ios-device-test

Claude Code slash commands for fast iOS verification:

| Command | What it does |
|---|---|
| `/fastSimulatorTest <screen or flow>` | Drives the app on Simulator through a JSON flow (fresh install, injected UserDefaults, PASS/FAIL line). Fans out one agent per simulator for a matrix. |
| `/fastDeviceTest <screen or flow>` | Runs the same JSON flow on a physical iPhone through a cached, auto-signed XCUITest runner; can also drive Settings, Shortcuts and SpringBoard. |
| `/fastUIReview <session>` | Builds contact sheets from a recorded session so every case's video is reviewed, not just its PASS line. |

Step by step, without writing a flow: `fastSimulatorTest do '<action or array>'` and
`fastDeviceTest do …` act on what is on screen and print the labels after the actions; `expect`
guards let one request carry several steps. `fastUIMap` prints what earlier runs saw of an app
(`--path-to <screen>` gives the way there as one request), and the `ui-explorer` subagent
(Haiku) runs long searches.

Every PASS flow run, and every `--before` run that failed at its outcome step, is filed as PR
evidence in `~/Desktop/<project> <ticket>/` (the ticket from the git branch): one captioned
sheet, the clips, and light per-shot JPEGs that `fastEvidenceSheet <spec.json>` renders again
after an edit. A filed run keeps only its `metrics.json` under `build/`. Both engines record with `--record` (the iPhone through XCTest's own
screen recording) and keep the clip at review quality (H.264, 960 px, ~1–2 MB for 20 s).

## Install (once per machine)

Needs Xcode (26 or 27). Nothing else: AXe 1.8.0 is bundled in `vendor/`. An AI agent can do the
whole setup from [SETUP.md](SETUP.md): every step has a command, the expected output and the fix
for each failure, including the checks for an iPhone (`fastDeviceTest check --device <name>`).

```bash
git clone https://github.com/DungVC-Dev/fast-ios-device-test.git ~/fast-ios-device-test
~/fast-ios-device-test/install.sh --link
```

Restart Claude Code. To upgrade later: `git -C ~/fast-ios-device-test pull`. With
`--link` the skill, commands and launchers point into the clone, so keep that folder.

Without git: download `fast-ios-device-test-<version>.zip` from the
[Releases](https://github.com/DungVC-Dev/fast-ios-device-test/releases) page, unzip it
anywhere and run its `install.sh` (no flag). That copies the tool to
`~/.local/share/fast-ios-device-test`, so the unzipped folder can be deleted.

Either way the installer unpacks the bundled `axe` into `~/.local/share/axe` when none
new enough is on PATH, installs Pillow if it can (only video review needs it), and
links the skill into `~/.claude/skills`, the commands into `~/.claude/commands` and
the launchers (`fastSimulatorTest`, `fastDeviceTest`, `fastUIReport`, `fastUIReview`, `fastUIMap`)
into `~/.local/bin`, and the `ui-explorer` subagent into `~/.claude/agents`. `install.sh --check`
prints what it sees and what is missing, without changing anything; `install.sh --check --device
<name>` also checks that iPhone.

Optional, for exploring a screen with Apple's own tools (pinch, drag, rotate, app
console log) before writing a flow: register Xcode 27's MCP server once with
`claude mcp add xcode -- xcrun mcpbridge`; the skill says when to use which.

Maintainers: `bash make-zip.sh` builds the release zip next to the folder.

## What's new

See [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md): 1.8.0 adds `two_finger_drag` on an iPhone (tilts a map). 1.7.0 files every passing flow run, and the bug's "before"
run, as PR evidence in one folder per ticket on the Desktop, and keeps nothing heavy under
`build/`. 1.6.0 reaches a screen visited before in one request
(`fastUIMap --path-to`), reuses the iPhone runner for flows and trims every step (1.8 s on the
iPhone, 2.9 s on the Simulator). 1.5.0 makes step-by-step runs fast on both engines
(`fastSimulatorTest do`, `expect` guards on multi-step requests, a refusal for destructive steps
in them). 1.4.0 adds the gestures a tester uses (hold, drag, edge
swipes, keys, pinch, rotate, orientation, Siri…), a screen map (`fastUIMap`) recorded from
normal runs, and prompt rules that answer each permission prompt its own way. 1.3.0 records the
iPhone screen, keeps every clip light
enough for a PR, and adds `fastEvidenceSheet`. 1.2.0 made the tool faster, made failures
explain themselves, drove system apps and installed without Homebrew.

## Setup per project

None. `/fastSimulatorTest` and `/fastDeviceTest` read everything from the flow
JSON the agent writes (scheme, bundle id, simulator, build folder); the skill
shows the smallest complete flow.
